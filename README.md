# Life

An application to access the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility).
Several search options (including a dynamic taxonomy tree), and dynamic fetching.
You can also add your own new specieses and occurrences (sightings), which get stored in the local Django DB (but will be fetched alongside the GBIF on querying).

New visual design. It's mobile responsive.

To run it, you need python and Django. You also need this package installed: https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/

Go to the root of the folder and enter the command:

### python manage.py runserver
#### in the browser search bar add '/life' to your local server address

#### And you're good to go :)
