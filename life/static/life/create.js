So here I remove the attributes again, instead of manually settiing the same attributes of the classList attributes in JS directly, to reverse it to the original (classList / CSS) style. This allows the hover style to be back in place. If I would here manually set the attributes from classList (like statBlock.style.color = 'white') it would look alright, but the hover would be gone. Also it's cleaner to remove it by setting it null, or you'd have to deal with to concurrent stylings.

						// (earlier I used for-in loop and wrote this): it's unexpected to me how 'y' is not undefined, but is literally saved in the setTimeouts for every cycle. The loop has long finished when the first animations start. The interpreter doesn't wait for .animation, .onfinish or setTimeout. So the peripheral y should be gone, but it's not. Anyways, more convenient this way. I can only explain it that the interpreter literally takes a snapshot of the setTimeout arrow function on every cycle, and replaces y with the value. Usually you get errors from functions only once they get executed, not just execution errors but also errors like undeclared varaibles are only realized on function execution, meaning the interpreter never looked at the function body before. But in this case it does apparently read the arrow functions before execution.
						// a moment later and I know now why. Having scrolled up after writing the upper line, I see the for-in loop and have a hunch, so I replace it with a classical for-loop and get undefineds as expected. Next stop is the MDN doc and everything becomes clear. It was a mistake to assume JS for...ins are like the ones in Python, they're very different. The intention of the JS for...in is to BECOME the key, in this case it's the indeces of the array. Because it reads keys as strings, it places the stringified indeces all over the loop-content aka setTimeout content, the interpreter then takes the string-number as a number and it works. JS for...ins have been designed to iterate through objects, hence the ability for y to become the key to access the values; so it iterates through the array-objects ("Array indexes are just enumerable properties with integer names and are otherwise identical to general object properties."), which makes them slower. They'll skip empty values, will yield added prototype properties, and are not guaranteed to keep order of array-elements, though I never had problems. That's why, while not considered bad practice, for-ins are generally not recommended for arrays outside of development.
						// But ironically, the fact that I didn't know about this before made everything work conveniently. ... it's sad, for-ins are so much more comfortable to write, I assumed originally this was their design purpose. Because it's literally a silly thing to write x<something.length, and also the something++ every time. Most of the time you just want to iterate from beginning, slot by slot, throw in a break if you want to get out earlier. for...of traverses the elements themselves, so for-in was literally the only one that would generate indeces from arrays with objects like taxaBlocks. I'm now annoyed that JS doesn't provide a lookable syntax for a loop that just automatically produces indeces and automatically iterates to end, like Python for...ins. for-of loops don't deliver as soon as you have various things going on that depend on the indeces.
						// Because of that I simply created an array 'ranks' (in startup.js) with integers of taxaKeys.length and use it to swap the for-ins with for-ofs.
